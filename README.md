SUBJECT OUTLINE 
24754 Studio 2: Specialisation 
Spring 2024 
Subject description 
The Specialisation Studio will allow students to apply   their   analytics   skills,   to   an   area   of analytics,   and   take   students through all the steps   required   in a business analytics   project.   In this   studio,   student   teams   will   be   provided   with   some   real-world tasks and   problems, from a range of industries   (e.g.   Finance,   Marketing   and   Health).   Students will   choose   an area that interests them and will develop a   solution   that   effectively   communicates   the   results.
Subject learning objectives (SLOs) 
Upon successful completion of this subject students should be   able   to:
1. apply   multiple data analytic techniques to data   in order to   convey   recommendations that   are   actionable   in   a   local
and international   setting
2. analyse assumptions of data analytics techniques that can affect   the   representation   of cultural   groups
3. evaluate data analysis techniques for decision   making
4. assess the data analysis   process to ensure that   it   is   performed   professionally and   ethically   and   takes   into   account   indigenous values
5. apply advanced data analytic   techniques to business   problems   to   extract   meaningful   insights from   complex   contexts
Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) 
This subject also contributes specifically to the following program learning objectives:
Research, identify and evaluate the assumptions implicit in data and apply analytical techniques to facilitate business decision making (1.1)
Critically evaluate and apply professional ethical standards, the principles of sustainability, social responsibility, and Indigenous values as business analysts (3.1)
Integrate advanced data analysis techniques with business practices to generate actionable knowledge to inform. and facilitate effective decision-making in local and international contexts (4.1)
Contribution to the development of graduate attributes 
This studio is designed to help students integrate and apply knowledge from their previous subject’s data analytics and present results. The students will write a report based on the findings that convey key recommendations and extract insights from data. Students will be expected to discern and evaluate what are the appropriate analytical techniques to be used with different types of data.
Students’ understandings of issues regarding representation of cultural groups in data analytics will be developed, and ethical issues in data analytics will be discussed.
This subject is aligned with the following graduate attributes:
Intellectual rigour and innovative problem solving
Social responsibility and cultural awareness
Professional and technical competence
Teaching and learning strategies 
This subject synthesises knowledge acquired in different subjects from the Business Analytics course.
Students will also use appropriate statistical software such as R and SAS, to complete assigned tasks. The project will be an authentic assessment using problems from industry partners.
The subject is taught by academic staff as well as industry professionals in an interactive setting. Both academic and industry staff will help guide and facilitate discussions in class as well as using webinar technologies.
Students are required to watch assigned videos and read specified articles and case study material in preparation for each class. These learning materials will be available on the subject webpages on the learning management system.
Students will be involved in active learning experiences during class. These experiences will be completed in collaboration with other students and will provide students with the opportunity to obtain in-class peer feedback on their learning as well as direct feedback from their lecturer. Additionally, feedback will be given to students online via video conferencing (e.g. Skype, Zoom) during times specified by the lecturer.
An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills to succeed at university and in the workplace. During the course of this subject, you will complete a milestone assessment task that will, in addition to assessing your subject-specific learning objectives, assess your English language proficiency.

Assessment 
Assessment task 1: Project Report and Analysis 
Objective(s): This addresses subject learning objective(代 写24754 Studio 2: Specialisation
代做程序编程语言s):   1,   3   and   5
This addresses program learning   objectives(s):   4.1
Groupwork: Group,   individually   assessed Weight: 65%
Task: The   project report   has   an   individual   (35%)   and   a   group   component   (30%).   The   group   portion   of thereport will demonstrate that a student can work together with others   in   compiling and   analysing   data.      The   individual   portion of the report will demonstrate that a student can   individually   complete   the   tasks   necessary   in an analytics report that would be viable   in   an   industry   setting.
The further details and information will be   available   on   Canvas.
Assessment task 2: Reflective Essay 
Objective(s): This addresses subject   learning objective(s):   2,   3   and 4 
This addresses program learning   objectives(s):
1.1   and   3.1 Groupwork: Individual Weight: 35%
Task: This   essay   will   demonstrate   that   the   students   understand   how   their   project   will   benefit   an
organization. The essay must show that the students   have   understood the   ethical   implications   of   their project and discuss the potential   positive and   negative   impacts   on   some   groups.This task   includes a milestone assessment component that evaluates   English   language   proficiency.   You   may be guided to further language support after   the   completion   of this   subject   if your   results   in      this   milestone task   indicate you   need   more   help with your language skills.

Assessment: faculty procedures and advice  
Extensions and late assessment protocol 
Any assessment task (excluding take-home final exams, frequent assessment tasks   that   must   be   submitted   on   a
regular basis   prior to or during a synchronous class   such   as weekly   homework   preparation,   pre-class   or   in-class
quizzes or single assessments that are performed and   assessed   during   class   time   such   as   presentations)   submitted after the due date and time, will   be   either:
.   penalised   by way of loss of marks where   10   per cent (10%)   of the   marks for the   assessment   task will   be   deducted   per day for assessment tasks submitted after the due date. A   day   is   defined   as   a   24-hour   period   or   part thereof
following the published due date and time   of the   assignment,   and
.   will   be   rejected and   not   marked   if the assessment   is submitted   more than five (5) calendar days   for   subjects   offered   in the   Main Calendar (Autumn, Spring and Summer)   and   seven   (7)   calendar   days   for   subjects   offered   in   the   UTS Online (Sessions   1 to 6), after the stated submission   date,   unless   a formal   short-term   extension   has   been   granted    by the Subject   Coordinator, or
.   rejected without marking (where the subject outline states   that   this will   be   the   consequence   of an   assessment   task   being submitted after the due time on the   due date   without   an   approved   extension)
The   maximum   penalty that can   be applied   is 50% of the assessment   marks. Students   cannot   receive   a   negative   score   for the assessment task after a   penalty   is   levied.
A penalty for late work will not apply   in   cases   of approved   extensions   by   the   Subject   Coordinator. Approved
extensions cannot be made without a   request for extension   sent   directly   to   the   coordinator   (or   nominated   approving
tutor as designated by the subject coordinator) for short-term   extensions   (within   the   timeframe   set   out   above)   or via   an application for special consideration (within the   UTS time frames for submission). Any direct   requests   must   be
received   by the Subject Coordinator at least 24   hours   prior to   the   due   date   and   time.
Students enrolled   in   UTS Online courses must complete the Request   for   Short   Extension   without Academic   Penalty form. to apply for a short-term   extension.
A penalty may not apply   after due   consideration   of any   submission   (request   for   extension   or   application   for   special      consideration) by the Academic   Liaison   Officer (ALO), on behalf of students   registered with Accessibility   Services .
